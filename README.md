# SciGuides Robot Base

This is the base repository used for projects in [SciGuides](https://github.com/SciBorgs/SciGuides). It is based on [Hydrogen](https://github.com/SciBorgs/Hydrogen), the base repository for the SciBorgs.

This repository is a *template*. To create your own repo from this template (i.e. for a SciGuides project), follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

## Codespaces

You can work on your robot code using github codespaces! This will allow you to develop and contribute from any computer, without worrying about installing anything.

To create a new codespace, press on the arrow below the green `Code` button and open the Codespaces tab. Then press `Create codespace on main`.

Between uses, make sure to stop your codespace! Open the Codespaces tab again, press the three dots next to your codespace, and press `stop codespace`. Then, when you want to use it again, just click on the codespace and it'll reopen!
